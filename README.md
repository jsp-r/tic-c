# tic.c

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, played between 2 players locally.


My first beginner project; a small exercise I did as part of a course on C programming.

Uses Cartesian coordinates to select features on the board!


## Usage


To select a tile, enter the x-coordinate of desired tile into the first input, followed by the y-coordinate into the second input.


   0  1  2
0  .  .  .

1  .  .  .

2  .  .  .

Player 1's turn!
Select an x coordinate to place your piece: 0
Select a y coordinate to place your piece: 0
   0  1  2
0  o  .  .   // 'o' symbol is placed on tile with coordinate (0, 0)

1  .  .  .

2  .  .  .



Use CTRL-C to stop the game at any time.
